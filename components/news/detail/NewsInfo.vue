Since September 2019, first stablecoins have been issued in the Ethereum blockchain according to the ERC-20 standard. After a month, Binance has started issuing them in its Binance Chain according to the BEP-2 standard. This decision allowed implementing them into decentralized applications of two different blockchains.</p>

Token contracts are used to issue Binance USD, so the stablecoin is technically not a coin but a token with a stable price. BUSD tokens issued on different blockchains are incompatible. So it is possible to send them only to the addresses of the corresponding networks and only through wallets with support for the corresponding blockchain. To buy BUSD for the first time on the Binance exchange or the Paxos website, it is necessary to pass the KYC procedure. Verification is needed due to regulators’ requirements in terms of stablecoins and fiat currencies. </p>
